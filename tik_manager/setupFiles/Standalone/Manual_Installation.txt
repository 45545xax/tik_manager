If somehow the compiled SmStandalone.exe is not working or you are on Linux / MacOs you can run SmStandalone.py

You need to have python 3.x installed.

In addition, you need the following libraries installed:

PyQt5 > v3.5
PyQt5-sip > v5.13.1
sip > v5.0.0

If you are on Linux or MacOs you need to have ffmpeg libraries installed too for mp4 conversion option.
For Windows, ffmpeg.exe is added inside the package
